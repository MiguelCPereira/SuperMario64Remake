# SuperMario64Remake

This project started its development during the spring of 2021 as an exam assignment for the "Graphics Programming 2" course at Howest University (part of the [Game Development](http://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/page/31/Game+Development) major). The main goal of the exam was to develop a short game using DirectX and HLSL, showcasing concepts such as Hardware Skinning, Shadow Mapping, Post Proccess Effects, amongst others.

As such, this project was developed in C++, using a DirectX-based engine named "OverlordEngine", which was offered to us as part of the course's materials in a semi-incomplete state - being up to each of us to expanded on it according to our project's needs.

I still intend on revisiting this remake later along the summer, but for now a fully playable version is already available.
