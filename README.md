# Super Mario 64 Remake

This project started its development during the spring of 2022 as an exam assignment for the "Graphics Programming 2" course at Howest University (part of the [Game Development](http://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/page/31/Game+Development) major). The main goal of this exam was to develop a short game using DirectX and HLSL, showcasing concepts such as Hardware Skinning, Shadow Mapping, Post Proccessing Effects, amongst others.

As such, this remake was programmed using a DirectX-based engine named "OverlordEngine", which was offered to us as part of the course's materials in a semi-incomplete state - being up to each of us to expanded on it according to our project's needs.

Although it started as an exam, I later revisited this project in my free time as to expand on it further and polish it a bit more. Some of the things I ended up adding in these extra weeks include the Chainchomp NPC, the camera clip-avoidance behaviour, the NPCs walking animations, and a considerable amount of general value-tweaking and bug-fixing.

The fully playable version is now available under the "Build" folder.
